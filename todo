# Steps
 - Separate out UI Render from doing the work to support non streamlit UI in future
 - Common Step State mgmt.
     - each step needs input, output and internal keys defined
     - step states
        - waitingOnDependencies - step can't start since it's dependent on upstream outputs
        - waitingInQueue - not started yet as not my turn
        - wipWaitingForStartAck - started but waiting for ack button
        - wipWaitingUserInput - in progress awaiting user input
        - wipWorking - in progress busy working
        - wipWaitingforDoneAck - all done awaiting to be acknowledge
        - done - next step can start 
     - step options
        - visibility:
            - one of 
                - never -  never show. Not valid if step needs user input
                - always - show always. If ui needs upstream then needs holding message
                - wipOrDone - show when in progress or done
        - expandability
            - idependent booleans
                - startExpanded - start expanded
                - autoExpandOnWip - auto expand going into a wip state 
                - autoCollapseOutWip - auto collapse going out of wip state
        - Visual elements
            - title: set to text if shown
            - start_ack_button: set to button text if there should be an aknowledge button 
            - done_ack_button: set to button text 
            - clear_button: clear outputs and state, back to wipWaitingForStartAck
            - expandable - toggle open or close by user and expandability 
            - copy data
            - divider
        - 
     - generic actions 
        - clear output 
        - 
     - each step can be cleared and rerun, run (configurable as some its a no op)
     - each step copy state button
     - each step show hide
     - should be able to map the flow and make style dependencies
     - can have branching (tabs)
     - can have loop backs
